        """
        Method to calculate the average value in a square neighbourhood using
        the 4-point algorithm to find the total sum over the neighbourhood.

        The output from the cumulate_array method can be used to
        calculate the sum over a neighbourhood of size
        (2*cells_x+1)*(2*cells_y+1). This sum is then divided by the area of
        the neighbourhood to calculate the mean value in the neighbourhood.

        At edge points, the sum and area of the neighbourhood are calculated
        for each point individually. For non-edge points, a faster, vectorised
        approach is taken:
        1. The displacements between the four points used to calculate the
           neighbourhood total sum and the central grid point are calculated.
        2. Four copies of the cumulate array output are flattened and rolled
           by these displacements to align the four terms used in the
           neighbourhood total sum calculation.
        3. The neighbourhood total at all non-edge points can then be
           calculated simultaneously in a single vector sum.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cube : iris.cube.Cube
            Cube to which neighbourhood processing is being applied. Must
            be passed through cumulate_array method first.

        -------
